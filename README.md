# Stock-market-trends
This repository is designed for a project that focuses on Reddit-based sentiment analysis and stock prediction. It integrates data collection from Reddit, sentiment analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning to predict stock market trends based on public discussions.  
# Key Components: 

# API Authentication.py: 
Authenticates access to Reddit's API using praw library with client credentials. 

# Feature Engineering.py:
Prepares data for machine learning by creating relevant features from raw text. 

# Library Imports.py:
Centralizes the import of all required Python libraries for consistency. 

# Machine Learning Model.py:
Implements machine learning models to predict stock movements based on Reddit data.

# Reddit Data Collection.py:
Collects posts and comments from specific subreddits related to finance. 

# Save Processed Data.py:
Saves the processed data in usable formats like .csv or .pickle. 

# Sentiment Analysis.py:
Analyzes the sentiment of Reddit data (positive, negative, or neutral) using sentiment analysis tools like textblob. 

# Setup & Installation.py:
Provides installation steps for required libraries. 

# Text Preprocessing.py:
Cleans and preprocesses text data by removing stopwords and performing tokenization. 

# Purpose:
The project collects financial discussions from Reddit, processes the data, performs sentiment analysis, and applies machine learning models to predict stock trends or market sentiment. The modular structure of the project allows for efficient data collection, preprocessing, and model training.  Applications: This project can be used for financial forecasting, market sentiment analysis, and understanding how Reddit discussions influence stock movements. It integrates data science, NLP, and machine learning to create a predictive model based on social media data.
